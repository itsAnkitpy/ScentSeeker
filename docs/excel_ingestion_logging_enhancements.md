# Excel Ingestion Logging Enhancements

This document summarizes the logging enhancements implemented for the Excel data ingestion pipeline. The goal was to make logging more structured, informative, and centralized for easier debugging and monitoring.

## 1. Structured Logging with Context

All relevant log messages across the ingestion services and commands were modified to include a structured context array. This provides detailed information pertinent to the specific log entry.

**Key services and commands updated:**

*   **`app/Console/Commands/IngestExcelCommand.php`**:
    *   Parser errors/warnings now include `['file_path', 'seller_code', 'batch_id']`.
    *   Staging service errors (general exceptions) now include `['file_path', 'seller_code', 'batch_id']`.
*   **`app/Services/DataIngestion/StagingDataService.php`**:
    *   Warnings for skipping items/prices due to missing data now include `['item_details', 'batch_id', 'seller_code']`.
    *   Errors during database operations (e.g., staging failures) now include `['batch_id', 'seller_code', 'exception_message', 'trace']`.
*   **`app/Services/DataIngestion/StagingProcessorService.php`**:
    *   Failure to find a seller logs `['seller_code_raw', 'staged_perfume_id', 'batch_id', 'error_message']`.
    *   Failure to process a staged perfume due to missing essential data (e.g., name, brand) logs `['staged_perfume_id', 'batch_id', 'seller_code_raw', 'details']`.
    *   General processing errors for a staged perfume log `['staged_perfume_id', 'batch_id', 'seller_code_raw', 'exception_message', 'trace']`.
*   **`app/Console/Commands/ProcessStagedDataCommand.php`**:
    *   Errors originating from the `StagingProcessorService` (caught as general exceptions in the command) log `['batch_id', 'exception_message', 'trace']`.

## 2. Granular Informational Logging in `StagingProcessorService`

More detailed informational logs were added to `StagingProcessorService.php` to track the lifecycle of data processing:

*   **Perfume Records:**
    *   `Log::info` messages are now generated when a production `Perfume` record is **created**. Context: `['perfume_id', 'name', 'staged_perfume_id', 'batch_id']`.
    *   `Log::info` messages are now generated when a production `Perfume` record is **updated**. Context: `['perfume_id', 'name', 'staged_perfume_id', 'batch_id']`.
*   **Price Records:**
    *   `Log::info` messages are now generated when a production `Price` record is **created**. Context: `['price_id', 'perfume_id', 'seller_id', 'size_ml', 'item_type', 'staged_perfume_id', 'staged_price_id', 'batch_id']`.
    *   `Log::info` messages are now generated when a production `Price` record is **updated**. Context: `['price_id', 'perfume_id', 'seller_id', 'size_ml', 'item_type', 'staged_perfume_id', 'staged_price_id', 'batch_id']`.
*   **Price Deactivation:**
    *   `Log::info` messages are now generated when production `Price` records are marked as "Out of Stock" (deactivated). Context: `['perfume_id', 'seller_id', 'deactivated_price_ids', 'count', 'batch_id']`.
*   **Processing Summary:**
    *   At the end of the `processStagedData` method, a summary `Log::info` message is generated, including the `batch_id` and an array of processing statistics (perfumes created/updated, prices created/updated, failed count).

## 3. Custom Log Channel: `ingestion`

To centralize ingestion-related logs and separate them from general application logs:

*   A new log channel named `ingestion` was configured in `config/logging.php`.
*   This channel uses the `daily` driver, writing logs to `storage/logs/ingestion.log`.
*   All `Log` calls within:
    *   `app/Console/Commands/IngestExcelCommand.php`
    *   `app/Services/DataIngestion/StagingDataService.php`
    *   `app/Services/DataIngestion/StagingProcessorService.php`
    *   `app/Console/Commands/ProcessStagedDataCommand.php`
    have been updated to use this dedicated channel (e.g., `Log::channel('ingestion')->info(...)`).

These enhancements provide a more robust and developer-friendly logging system for the data ingestion pipeline, facilitating easier monitoring, debugging, and operational oversight.
